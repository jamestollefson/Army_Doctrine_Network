# Army_Doctrine_Network
Network analysis of Army doctrine as of June 2017

This project examines the U.S. Army's doctrinal corpus as of June 2017. The main point of this project
is to iterate through .txt versions of all the Army's doctrinal texts, pull out and store every reference in each
document to any other doctrinal publication, and then build a visualization of a multi-directional network
graph using that information. This allows us to examine both the overall distribution of certain network traits
(e.g. centrality, degree, clustering) and draw conclusions about the Army's doctrine.

Only a few of the Army's doctrinal publications are included in this repository. These are meant to serve as 
examples to allow people who access this repository to run the code without having to convert all the Army's
doctrinal pubs to .txt files themselves. However I have not included everything because many of these pubs
are only accessible with Common Access Card (CAC) access to the Army Publishing Directorate (www.apd.army.mil) and I don't intend
to be responsible for spilling those documents in an unsecured fashion all over the Internet.
